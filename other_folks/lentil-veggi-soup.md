# Lentil Vegetable Soup

From Discount_Mithral on Reddit

I really just winged it - but I'll transcribe it as best as memory allows, lol!

## Ingredients

    1 1/2c brown lentils, rinsed and picked over

    1 small yellow onion, diced

    2 med carrots, chopped

    1 poblano pepper, diced

    3-5 cloves garlic, chopped

    1lb yukon gold potatoes, diced (any potato would work, but I love the golds or reds for soups)

    4-5c. veggie stock

    Dried herbs: I used Thyme, rosemary, dill, oregano, and parsley

    Red wine vinegar

    S&P

## Directions

Rinse and drain lentils after picking them over for stones or weird looking lentils. Brown onions in a heavy bottom pot for 
~5 min, then add in carrots, cook for another 3-5min. Add in your garlic and pepper along with the dried herbs and cook for 
a minute or two. Add in the stock slowly, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.

Add in your lentils and potatoes along with salt (I did about 1 1/2Tbs) and pepper. I start with 4c. stock and add more as 
needed to *just* cover the potatoes. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and cover. Cook for about 20min at a low simmer and 
taste for salt. Add in the vinegar just before serving.

## Comments

If you have a large crowd - you can add more stock and add in some greens like kale or spinach to bulk it out. This is 
really a measure with your heart recipe!
