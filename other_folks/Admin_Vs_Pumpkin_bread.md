# Admin V’s Famous Pumpkin Bread

By Admin V on SoL FB

## Ingredients

* 3 cups sugar
* 1 cup cooking oil
* 4 eggs 
* 3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour 
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 ½ teaspoons salt
* 1 heaping tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 heaping tablespoon ground nutmeg
* 1 teaspoon of ginger
* ½ teaspoon of ground cloves
* ½ teaspoon of cardamom (This is a new ingredient.  Don’t know if it adds much.  Just for a depth of flavor)
* 1 tablespoon of vanilla
* ⅔ cup water 
* 1 15 ounce can pumpkin
* ⅔ cup of dried cranberries
* ⅔ cup of pecans (chopped)

## Directions

Grease the bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of two 9x5x3-inch, three 8x4x2-inch, or four 7-1/2x3 1/2-x2-inch loaf pans; set aside. In a very large mixing bowl beat sugar and oil with an electric mixer on medium speed. Add vanilla.  Add eggs one at a time and beat well; set aside.

In a large bowl combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, and nutmeg. Add flour mixture and water alternately to sugar mixture, beating on low speed after each addition just until combined. Beat in pumpkin.  Mix in cranberries and pecans.  Spoon batter into prepared pans

Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 55 to 65 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near centers comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove from pans. Cool completely on wire racks. Wrap and store overnight before slicing. 

## V’s Tips

Recipes are like the pirate’s code.  More like guidelines than actual rules.  

You don’t have to use cranberries and nuts.  You can make it without them.  You could do dried cherries or raisins.  I’ve used walnuts instead of pecans.  

I don’t really measure the spices or the vanilla.  While you can go overboard, it is hard to do.  I love cinnamon and nutmeg so I keep adding it until it looks right.  Start with my estimated measurements but adjust to your own taste.  

Sometimes it takes more than the 55 minutes to bake.  Sometimes less. Start checking at 45 minutes and just keep an eye on it until your skewer or toothpick comes out clean.
