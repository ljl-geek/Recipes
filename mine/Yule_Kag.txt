Yule Kag  (Danish version of Stollen)

2 cups milk
1 1/4 cup butter, softened *
2 cups sugar
1 tsp salt
2 small cakes yeast (2 packets)
1/2 cup warm water
3 cups flour
15 cardamom seeds ground OR 1 rounded tsp
3 eggs, well beaten *
1 lb jar candied fruits, floured *  
7 cups more flour

(makes 2 or 3 loaves, depending on size of pan)

Scald milk.  Add to it the softened butter.  
When butter has melted in milk, add sugar and salt. Cool.
Dissolve yeast in warm water.  
Add yeast and 3 cups flour to butter & milk mixture.  Beat well.
Let dough rise 1 hour in warm place. (r1)
Add cardamom, floured fruit, well beaten eggs and 
just enough flour to handle (dough should be stiff.) [About 7 cups]
Knead thoroughly, then let dough rise until light - Takes A Long Time!! (r2)
Stir down and knead gently.
Fill 3 (or 2 if very large) bread tins 1/2 full.
Let rise again until double in bulk. (r3).
(preheat oven to 400 degrees F when nearly risen) 
Bake ten (10) minutes in hot (400 deg) oven, then...  
Reduce heat to moderate (325 deg) oven, and bake about 40 min, 
or until none of dough clings to a tester.

Note: This dough is slow rising.  To make this bread usually takes 
about 12 chours from start to finish -- sometimes longer.  Rising 
can be sped up by a few minutes in a warm (~100 deg) oven, but to 
do so makes lots of holes in the bread -- not so great.
