## üç≥ Alicia‚Äôs Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Rough chop the base
In a food processor, roughly chop 2 small cases of mushrooms and 1 large onion. Set that mix aside.

2. Blend aromatics
In the same food processor or blender, pulse together 5 cloves of garlic and 2 sprigs of tarragon. Set that blend aside in a small bowl. (Keep blender dirty ‚Äî you‚Äôll use it again in step 5!)

3. Saut√© the veggies
In a large soup pot, heat 2 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil. Add the mushroom and onion mix. Season with salt, pepper, Tony Chachere‚Äôs no-salt Creole seasoning, and 2 tbsp lemon juice. Saut√© over low to medium heat for about 15 minutes until the mushrooms release their juices and everything softens.

4. Add garlic & tarragon
Stir in the blended garlic and tarragon. Let that cook gently with the mix ‚Äî the mushroom juices will continue to simmer everything down.

5. Make the creamy thickener
In the same blender used for the garlic and tarragon, pour in a few cups of hot Better Than Bouillon Roasted Garlic broth. Add 2‚Äì3 tablespoons of flour. Blend until smooth. This creates a flavorful, creamy base that helps thicken without clumps.

6. Combine everything
Pour the blended broth mixture into the mushroom pot. Stir well and let it all come together. Add additional broth until the soup is just loose enough to ladle ‚Äî not too thick, not watery.

7. Add the cream
Stir in 3 cups of heavy cream. Let the soup cook gently on low heat while you heat up your pressure canner and pint jars.

8. Add texture (optional)
Before jarring, rough chop a small handful of mushrooms and onions for texture and stir them into the pot.

9. Jar & prep
Once jars are hot, ladle the hot soup into pint jars, leaving 1 inch headspace. Wipe rims with vinegar. Apply lids and rings.

10. Pressure can rebel-style
Process at 10 lbs pressure for 35 minutes (pints) ‚Äî adjust for your altitude.
(Note: USDA typically recommends longer times for thick soups, but this is Alicia‚Äôs rebel timing based on her own results. Always store and use with care.)

11. Cool & store
Allow jars to cool undisturbed for 12‚Äì24 hours. Check seals, label with date, and store in a cool, dark pantry.
