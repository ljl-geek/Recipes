# Recipes
A place to put cooking recipes that I have collected. 

# What kind?
Literally anything that is food or drink. 

My soap formulations, if I start making soap again, will be in a different repo.

# Why?
I have my recipes scattered between text files on my computer, notes in my cooking notebook, and 3x5 cars in a file box. I'm a geek, so puting them in a git repo just makes sense. 

Also, if I give someone else canned or preserved items, they can look here for ingredients.

# Who?
These are a mixture of mine and my family's recipes plus ones that I've saved from other sources. I will try to note which ones I've actually made.

# PRs, Merges and Forks
Yes, you can fork these if you like. The ones that are "mine" or my family's I would appreciate you maintaining attribution on. The ones where I've lost the attribution, I am sorry about, and if you know the attribution a PR would be welcome.
