Scott Rossâ€¦wherever you are (sorry I lost the post to tag you in!), posted this sandwich 
loaf recipe and I canâ€™t thank you enough! This is the fourth recipe Iâ€™ve tried that 
finally has not failed, has exceeded my expectations, and I havenâ€™t even cut into it 
yet, but I can tell theyâ€™re going to be stellar! Thank you!! ðŸ¤—

Hereâ€™s the recipe: 

1 Cup starter
21/2 Cups Luke warm water
2 Tablespoons Honey
1 Tablespoon Salt
1/2 Cup Butter (softened)
8 Cups Unbleached All Purpose Flour

In a stand mixer:

* Add water and starter to mixing bowl and stir until incorporated.
* Next add honey, salt, and butter.
* Turn on mixer with dough hook(s) inserted and add flour a cup at a time.
* After all flour is incorporated, let it knead for 10 minutes or until dough is smooth 
and stretches (window pane) without tearing.

Transfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled 
or a bit more.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into two portions.

Press and stretch each portion as wide as your loaf pans are long, and long enough to 
roll up into a "log" and fold the ends under on the "seam" side.

Place in greased or nonstick loaf pans and cover with plastic wrap to rise until over 
the top of the pan.

Place in pre-heated oven at 350Â°F for 45 minutes. Remove from loaf pans and place on a 
rack to cool. Brush tops with butter while warm to keep crust soft.
