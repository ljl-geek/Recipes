PRESERVED GARLIC
Pauline Thiele

Wash and peel (see hint just below)
* 900 grams (2 pounds) garlic.

Barboil for 1 minute (this prevents the garlic from changing colour, ie blue , green or purple and makes the garlic easier to ‘peel’ if you do it first).

Strain and mince the 900g garlic, reserving the liquid to make garlic stock.  Set aside. 

Add to a new bowl
* 1 - 11/4 (one and one-forth) cup water

Dissolve 
* 1 1/2 teaspoon citric acid
* 1 tablespoon white vinegar

Blend together the garlic and water solution.

Fill 8oz jars with the garlic , leaving a 15mm headspace .

Waterbath for 1 hour in a Fowler’s Vacola unit (if in Australia), or cover in a waterbath by 1 inch of water, bring to the boil and process for at least 10 minutes.

GARLIC STOCK

* This can be used in cooking or is a natural repelant for bugs in the garden (put in a spray bottle).
** Would be really good used in potato recipes.

For each cup of garlic water (reserved from parboiling the garlic for 1 minute).
Add:
* 1/4 teaspoon citric acid
* 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar.

Add to 8oz jars, leaving 15mm head space.  Clean rim and any rubber bands.

Process as above for garlic.
