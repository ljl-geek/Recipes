# Bannock Bread for Imbolc

By gather Victoria 

### Ingredients

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 cup oat flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled
* 1/2 cup cream or milk (plus one extra tablespoon for the caudle)
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary (1 tablespoon dried)
* 1 tsp. of grated orange zest (optional)
* 3 tablespoons of sugar (and three more tablespoons for sprinkling)
* 1 egg yolk (for the caudle)


### Directions

* Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease a cast iron skillet or baking sheet.
* Place the oats, flour, salt, sugar, rosemary and orange zest in a large bowl, mix together with a fork. Cut the cold butter into the flour mixture. Stir in the cream until all the flour is absorbed.
* Gather the rough dough together and place on a surface lightly dusted with oat flour. Knead until the dough holds its consistency (but don’t overwork).
* Divide the dough in half and roll out each half into a circle about 1/4 inch thick.
* In small jar, vigorously mix your egg yolk with a tablespoon of cream. Then brush the mixture over the top of the bannock. Sprinkle with sugar.
* Cut each circle into 4 wedges and arrange the wedges 1/4 inch apart on the baking sheet.
* Bake about 20 minutes or until golden and crisping at the edges.

Note: you can also apply a second brushing of caudle and sugar halfway through baking – I did!
