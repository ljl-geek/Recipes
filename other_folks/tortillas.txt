Flour Tortillas
by Shay López 

Here’s the recipe everyone: 

I used 
2 cups of flour, 
1 tsp salt, 
1 tsp baking powder, 
4 tbs melted butter and 
3/4 cup of warm water.

Add the flour, salt and baking powder to a large bowl and mix well. 

Then add the melted butter (let it cool first before adding). 

Start mixing with your hand while slowly adding the water. 

Knead for about 5 min and shape into a ball. 

Next divide the dough into 8 equal sized balls. 

Roll out the dough balls using a little flour. 

Then in a skillet over medium heat cook the tortillas for about 1 min on each side. 

The tortillas should bubble up.
