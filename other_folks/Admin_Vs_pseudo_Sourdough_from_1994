# Adin V’s “Sourdough” Bread from 1994

## Starter

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 3 Tablespoons of instant potatoes
* 2 packets of yeast (I don’t know what that translates to in today’s yeast measurements.  I’m guessing a couple of teaspoons)
* 1 cup of warm water

Let stand outside the refrigerator all day.  In theory, you don’t need to use redneck tupperware, but in 1994, I used an old cool whip container.  Store in the refrigerator  when not needed. Let sit out before feeding. Feed every 3 to 5 days.

## Bread

* 6 cups bread flour (I don’t know how necessary the bread flour is, but I used it in 1994)
* 1 cup starter.
* ½ cup sugar
* ½ cup oil (vegetable or canola)
* ½ cup warm water
* 1 tablespoon of salt

Combine all the ingredients into a large bowl.  Grease a secondary bowl and turn the dough over in the greased bowl to coat all sides.  Let stand 8-12 hours until doubled in size.  After the first rise, punch down the bread.  Dump out onto a floured surface and knead a little (Grandma’s words)  I kneaded the whole thing 3 or 4 times to help develop the gluten, but we will knead again.  Divide into three loaves.  Knead and shape each individual loaf.  Let rise for another 8-12 hours in greased loaf pans.  Bake for 35 minutes in a 350 oven until golden brown

## Notes

The bread turns out really well when you have a starter that works.  I am going to give this one a try next week.  Taking care of the starter was like having a really needy pet.  I can hear my grandma giving me the directions when I read the recipe.  She’s been dead since 2017 so it is nice to hear from her again even if it is just in my head.
