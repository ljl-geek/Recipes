Riva's Marmalade:

* 2 Oranges
* 1 Lemon
* 4 Apples
* 1 cup crushed pineapple
* Sugar

Remove peals and seeds from oranges and lemon. 
Peel and core apples. 
Grind apples and chop lemon and oranges. 
Add pineapple.
Simmer until apples are soft then blend until smooth. 
Add sugar.
Bring back to a boil then simmer for 1/2 hour. 
Put in jars and process in water bath for 10 minutes. 

The recipe said to measure the fruit and add equal amount of sugar. I thought that was too much. 

I tripled the recipe and added 4 cups of sugar. 

You will have to do it to taste depended on the amount) 

(I tripled the recipe and got 15 half pints.)
