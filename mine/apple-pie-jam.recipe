Apple pie jam: 

Core and cut apples into small chunks. 
Put in big pot with enough cider to cover. 
Add apple pie spices. 
Cook down until soft. 
Add lemon juice, Ball low sugar pectin (based on amount of fruit) and just enough sugar to activate the pectin. 
Bring to a boil. 
When it starts to thicken up, put in jars and water bath for 15 minutes. 
(Quantities are based on whatever pot and pectin you have. Use real cider or apple juice.)
