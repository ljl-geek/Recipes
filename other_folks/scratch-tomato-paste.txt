Tomato paste! 
Danielle Ayla Pettyjohn

It's insane how simple it is!

Ingredients:
* Roma tomatoes.

Chunk them into rough quarters.

Put in a pot over a decent boil until reduced by about half. 

Cool and put in a blender.

Pour blended tomato goop into an oven safe pan, and bake at 200F for 4-however many hours until you get your desired texture.
(scrape sides every 30m-1hr so it doesn't burn on there)
