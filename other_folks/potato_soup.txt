Great Depression recipe
(From my grandmother) - 

This is a basic potato soup that you can add anything you want to it.
It is absolutely delicious so I don't feel depressed while I'm eating it at all LOL

Peel 10 lb of potatoes
Chop them into 2-in pieces
Peel 2 sweet yellow onions
Slice them into rings and break them apart
Put them in a 12 quart stew pot
Cover them with water
plus 2 inches of water above potatoes and onions
Boil until tender
Add one stick of real butter
Add one cup of heavy whipping cream
Salt and pepper to taste

If you're going to be offering bacon
be really careful with the salt
I suggest serving toppings on the side
If you want to thicken the soup do not add flour or cornstarch
Instead just remove a few potatoes and mash them and add them back to the pot
Repeat the process until its  thick as you want it
You can put toppings on the side
such as green onions, bacon, shredded cheese, hard boiled eggs
Serve with unsweetened cornbread
