# Nocino - Walnut Liquor

From Kayce Heister

## Ingredients
You need 1 large jar (I use 1/2 gallon) and gloves 

* 2-3 pounds fresh green walnuts ( I collect them from the tree)
* 1 1/2 liters of good quality vodka
* 3 cups raw honey, sugar or maple syrup
* 3 cups water 

### SPICES ARE OPTIONAL 
* 1 vanilla bean
* 1-2 star anise 
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 6 cloves
* 6 spicebush berries 
* 1 whole lemon zest 

### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Wearing gloves, chop the green walnuts in half. I usually take my knife, get it wedged in the walnut, and hit it on the cutting board. This seems to do the trick cutting them in half.

2. Add the halved walnuts to the jar and spices if using. Fill with vodka and place a secure fitting lid. Allow the jar to sit for 4-6 weeks, shaking every few days.

3. Afterwards, strain out your walnuts and spices using a cheesecloth and strainer. Add liquid to a new clean jar (I use a 1 gallon at this point).

4. Mix water and honey (sugar source) together until it dissolved. Add sugar water to the walnut liquor, mixing well (Adjust the proportions to make a stronger or sweeter end result.)

5. Place the resulting liqueur into liquor bottles, and store in a cool place to age for another 4-6 months. The longer it sits, the milder it will be. 

Nocino can be consumed over ice, or mixed with other beverages and sipped after a meal, as a tonic and digestive aid.

### Comments

üçÉ Black walnuts are one of my favorite trees and here on the homestead, I have many. Not only do I tap them and make walnut syrup every year, they provide me with parasite protection, digestive help and nuts for winter time! Truly an all around amazing, useful tree.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 

Pregnant women and people with nut allergies should avoid nocino. It's important to note that Although this beverage is diluted with sugar water, black walnut does contain the compound Juglone, which can be toxic and high amounts.
