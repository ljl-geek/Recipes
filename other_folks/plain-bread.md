# Basic Yeast Bread

by Joana Marie 

Uneven shaped but we havenâ€™t bought bread for like a year since I learned to make them myself.

### Ingredients
* 2 tsp yeast
* 1/4 c sugar ( You can use less )
* 1 c warm water
* 3 c flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 c veg oil 

### Directions
* proof yeast
* add the rest of the ingredients
* knead until smooth 
* rest for 1 hour (warm place)
* Cut and shape 
* transfer to your lined pan ( I use glass baking dish hence the uneven shapes ğŸ˜‚ )
* rest until doubled in size
* Bake for 375f for 20-25 minutes ( I use the bottom rack )
