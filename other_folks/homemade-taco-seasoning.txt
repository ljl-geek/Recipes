Homemade Taco Seasoning
Jen Courville Hodgeman

Iâ€™ve been making my own taco seasoning for years simply because I always forgot to buy it. ðŸ¤£
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp oregano

I make big batches of this and it stores well. 1/4 cup is roughly equal to 1 pkg taco seasoning.
