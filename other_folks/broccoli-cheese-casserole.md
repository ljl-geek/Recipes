# Broccoli Cheese Casserole

from purpleprose78 on Reddit

I want you to know that this is not healthy and barely counts as a vegetable side dish

### Ingredients

* 1 large bag of broccoli (16 ish oz), cooked and chopped
* 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.
* grated cheese (you measure this with your heart, but at least a cup)
* 1 sleeve of crushed ritz crackers
* 1 stick of butter, melted.
* (Salt and pepper to taste)

### Directions

* In a medium sized casserole dish, combine the broccoli, cream of mushroom soup, and most of the cheese.
* Salt and pepper to taste.
* Mix well.
* Top with the Ritz crackers, the rest of the cheese, and the melted butter.
* Bake covered in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes until casserole is nice and bubbly.

I cannot stress this enough. You should feel free to add extra cheese and other things that you think would make it better. 
Sometimes, my mom will add an egg for structure. When I make it myself, I don't because I don't think it needs it. This is 
an occasional food. I only eat it on special occasions because it a heart attack plus a side of broccoli.
