* 100g (1/2 cup) lukewarm water
* 105g (1/2 cup) buttermilk
* 115g (1/2 cup) active sourdough starter
* 7g (2 tsp) active dry yeast (if you let your dough bulk ferment for several hours and then sit in the fridge you can avoid yeast)

✨Mix all ingredients except flour. Let everything sit for 5 mins while the yeast bubbles then mix flour in. 
✨Knead flour on the counter (or use a mixer) and work until smooth. 
✨Let sit until doubled in size (I left mine for almost 2 hours).
